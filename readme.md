# Claude Engineer

Claude Engineer is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) that leverages the power of Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model to assist with software development tasks. This tool combines the capabilities of a large language model with practical file system operations and web search functionality.

## Features

- Interactive chat interface with Claude-3.5-Sonnet
- File system operations (create folders, files, read/write files)
- Web search capabilities using Tavily API
- Syntax highlighting for code snippets
- Project structure creation and management
- Code analysis and improvement suggestions
- Vision capabilities support for via drag and drop of images in the terminal

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Doriandarko/claude-engineer.git
   cd claude-engineer
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your API keys:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to create a new `.env` file:
     ```
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_anthropic_api_key_here
     TAVILY_API_KEY=your_actual_tavily_api_key_here
     ```
   - The script will automatically load these environment variables using python-dotenv
   - Note: Never commit your actual `.env` file to version control

## Usage

### Running with Docker

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

2. Run the following command:
