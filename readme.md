## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-engineer.git
   cd claude-engineer
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your API keys:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to create a new `.env` file:
     ```
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_anthropic_api_key_here
     TAVILY_API_KEY=your_actual_tavily_api_key_here
     ```
   - The script will automatically load these environment variables using python-dotenv
   - Note: Never commit your actual `.env` file to version control

## 🚀 Usage

### Running with Python

Run the main script to start the Claude Engineer interface:

```
python main.py
```

### Running with Docker

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

2. Run the following command:
   ```
   docker-compose run --rm claude-engineer
   ```

   This command runs the container in interactive mode and removes it after use.

3. To stop the container, type `exit` in the Claude Engineer interface or press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

### Interacting with Claude Engineer

Once started, you can interact with Claude Engineer by typing your queries or commands. Some example interactions:

- "Create a new Python project structure for a web application"
- "Explain the code in file.py and suggest improvements"
- "Search for the latest best practices in React development"
- "Help me debug this error: [paste your error message]"
- "Analyze this image and describe its contents"

Special commands:
- Type 'exit' to end the conversation and close the application.
- Type 'image' to include an image in your message for analysis.
- Type 'automode [number]' to enter Autonomous mode with a specific number of iterations.
- Press Ctrl+C at any time to exit the automode and return to regular chat.

### 🤖 Improved Automode

The enhanced automode allows Claude to work autonomously on complex tasks with greater efficiency and control. When in automode:

1. Claude sets clear, achievable goals based on your request.
2. It works through these goals one by one, using available tools as needed.
3. Claude provides regular updates on its progress, including the current iteration count.
4. Automode continues until goals are completed or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
5. You can specify the maximum number of iterations when entering automode (default is 25).

To use automode:
1. Type 'automode [number]' when prompted for input, where [number] is the maximum number of iterations.
2. Provide your request when prompted.
3. Claude will work autonomously, providing updates after each iteration.
4. Automode exits when the task is completed, after reaching the maximum number of iterations, or when you press Ctrl+C.

### 📊 Enhanced Diff-based File Editing

Claude Engineer now supports an improved diff-based file editing system, allowing for more precise and controlled modifications to existing files. The new workflow includes:

1. Reading the entire content of a file using the `edit_and_apply` function without providing new content.
2. Applying changes to the file using the `edit_and_apply` function with new content, which shows a detailed diff of the proposed changes.

When editing files, Claude will:

1. Show a detailed diff of the proposed changes, highlighting additions, removals, and unchanged lines with color coding using the Rich library.
2. Focus on adding new code or modifying existing code without unnecessarily removing functionality.
3. Provide a summary of lines added and removed.
4. Apply changes carefully to avoid duplicates and unwanted replacements.
5. Support various editing scenarios, including targeted changes, appending content, inserting at the beginning, and replacing entire file contents.

This feature enhances Claude's ability to make targeted improvements to your codebase while maintaining the integrity of existing functionality.

### 🧠 Dynamic System Prompt

The system prompt is now dynamically updated based on whether the script is in automode or not. This allows for more tailored instructions and behavior depending on the current operating mode:

1. In regular mode, Claude focuses on providing helpful responses and using tools as needed.
2. In automode, Claude is instructed to work autonomously, set goals, and provide regular updates on progress.

The dynamic system prompt enhances Claude's ability to adapt to different scenarios and provide more relevant assistance.

### 🔧 Available Tools

Claude Engineer comes with a set of powerful tools to assist with various tasks:

1. create_folder: Create a new folder at a specified path.
2. create_file: Create a new file at a specified path with content.
3. edit_and_apply: Read the contents of a file, and optionally apply changes.
4. read_file: Read the contents of a file at the specified path.
5. list_files: List all files and directories in the specified folder.
6. tavily_search: Perform a web search using Tavily API to get up-to-date information.

These tools allow Claude to interact with the file system, manage project structures, and gather information from the web as needed.

### 🖼️ Image Analysis

Claude Engineer now supports image analysis capabilities. To use this feature:

1. Type 'image' when prompted for input.
2. Drag and drop your image file into the terminal or provide the file path.
3. Provide a prompt or question about the image.
4. Claude will analyze the image and respond to your query.

This feature enables Claude to assist with tasks involving visual data, such as analyzing diagrams, screenshots, or any other images relevant to your development work.
